weather app UI only using HTML and CSS  
This Simple Weather App (UI-only) project is a front-end design built with pure HTML and CSS, showing a modern, responsive interface for displaying weather information.

Key Points:

Static UI — no live weather API integration (dummy placeholder data).

Top bar with branding, search field, and toggle placeholders (dark mode & °C/°F).

Current weather card with location, date/time, temperature, weather icon, description, and extra facts like humidity, wind, UV index.

Right-side metrics showing high/low temperatures, precipitation, cloud cover, and pressure as progress bars.

5-day forecast section with minimal weather icons, temperature ranges, and descriptions.

Responsive layout — adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Uses CSS gradients, shadows, and custom icons for a modern visual style.
